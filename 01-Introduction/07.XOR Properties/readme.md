# Challenge: XOR Properties 

- **Category**: Introduction / Encoding
- **Points**: 15  

## ğŸ“– Problem Description 

In the last challenge, you saw how XOR worked at the level of bits. In this one, we're going to cover the properties of the XOR operation and then use them to undo a chain of operations that have encrypted a flag. Gaining an intuition for how this works will help greatly when you come to attacking real cryptosystems later, especially in the block ciphers category.  

There are four main properties we should consider when we solve challenges using the XOR operator  
```
Commutative: A âŠ• B = B âŠ• A
Associative: A âŠ• (B âŠ• C) = (A âŠ• B) âŠ• C
Identity: A âŠ• 0 = A
Self-Inverse: A âŠ• A = 0
```
