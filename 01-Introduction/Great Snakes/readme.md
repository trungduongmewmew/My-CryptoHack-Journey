# Challenge: Great Snakes

- **Category**: Introduction / General
- **Points**: 3

## üìñ Problem Description

Modern cryptography involves code, and code involves coding. CryptoHack provides a good opportunity to sharpen your skills.

Of all modern programming languages, Python 3 stands out as ideal for quickly writing cryptographic scripts and attacks. For more information about why we think Python is so great for this, please see the FAQ.

Run the attached Python script and it will output your flag.

**Challenge files:**
- `great_snakes.py`

## ü§î Thought Process

This is an introductory challenge designed to ensure we have a working Python 3 environment. The instructions are straightforward: download the provided Python script and execute it. The script itself should contain the logic to generate or print the flag directly.

There's no complex cryptography involved. The main steps are:
1.  Download the `great_snakes.py` file.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where the file was saved.
4.  Execute the script using the Python 3 interpreter.

## üêç Solution

The solution is to simply run the provided Python script.

1.  **Download the script:**
    Save the `great_snakes.py` file provided by the challenge.

2.  **Execute the script from the terminal:**
    Open your terminal, navigate to the correct folder, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 great_snakes.py
    ```
    *(Note: Depending on your system's configuration, you might need to use `python` instead of `python3`)*

3.  **Get the flag:**
    After running the command, the script will print the flag directly to the console.

    ```
    crypto{z3n_0f_pyth0n}
    ```

## üìù Key Takeaways

* This challenge emphasizes the importance of having a functional Python 3 environment for solving crypto challenges.
* It serves as a simple "hello world" to get comfortable with the process of downloading a file, running a script, and submitting a flag on the CryptoHack platform.
