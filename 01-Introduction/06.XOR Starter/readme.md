## 📖 Problem Description   

XOR is a bitwise operator which returns 0 if the bits are the same, and 1 otherwise. In textbooks the XOR operator is denoted by `⊕`, but in most challenges and programming languages you will see the caret `^` used instead.  
                            | A | B | Output |
                            |:-:|:-:|:------:|
                            | 0 | 0 | 0 |
                            | 0 | 1 | 1 |
                            | 1 | 0 | 1 |
                            | 1 | 1 | 0 |  
For longer binary numbers we XOR bit by bit: `0110 ^ 1010 = 1100`. We can XOR integers by first converting the integer from decimal to binary. We can XOR strings by first converting each character to the integer representing the Unicode character.
