# My CryptoHack Journey 🚀

Welcome to the repository documenting my journey of learning Cryptography and solving challenges on the [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/) platform.

The goal of this repository is not just to store solution scripts, but to serve as a detailed "digital notebook" where I document my thought processes, theoretical knowledge, and the mistakes I've made along the way. I hope this serves as a helpful resource for others who are also on the path to mastering this fascinating field.

## 🎯 Personal Goals

* To complete all challenges on CryptoHack.
* To master theoretical concepts from basic to advanced levels.
* To build a personal toolbox of useful scripts to solve problems more efficiently.
* To write clear and concise write-ups to solidify my own understanding and share knowledge with the community.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is systematically organized to mirror the learning modules on CryptoHack, making it easy to follow and reference.

/My-Crypto-Journey  
├── README.md  
├── 01-Introduction  
├── 02-Modular_Arithmetic  
├── 03-Symmetric_Ciphers  
├── 04-Public-Key_Cryptography  
├── 05-Elliptic_Curves  
├── 06-Miscellaneous  
└── Toolbox


* **`01` to `05`**: These main directories correspond to the learning sections on CryptoHack. Each contains theoretical notes (`README.md` inside) and challenge write-ups.
* **`06-Miscellaneous`**: For challenges that don't fall into the main learning path, such as Brainteasers, Mathematics, etc.
* **`Toolbox`**: Contains self-developed, reusable scripts, functions, and tools.

## 📊 Progress Tracker

This table tracks my personal progress. I will update it regularly as I complete new sections.

*(Legend: ✅ - Completed | ⏳ - In Progress | ❌ - Not Started)*

| Module | Theory | Challenges | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **01. Introduction** | ✅ | ⏳ | Mastering basic encoding schemes. |
| **02. Modular Arithmetic** | ❌ | ❌ | The mathematical foundation for modern crypto. |
| **03. Symmetric Ciphers** | ❌ | ❌ | Learning about AES, Block Cipher Modes. |
| **04. Public-Key Crypto** | ❌ | ❌ | Focusing on RSA and its common attacks. |
| **05. Elliptic Curves** | ❌ | ❌ | An advanced and exciting topic. |

## 🛠️ Tools & Language

* **Primary Language:** Python
* **Common Libraries:** `pycryptodome`, `gmpy2`, `requests`, `pwntools`.

## 🔗 Helpful Resources

Besides CryptoHack, here are a few other resources I find helpful in my learning process:
* [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/): A classic set of exercises to build a strong crypto foundation.
* [Asecuritysite](https://asecuritysite.com/): A website with a vast collection of cryptographic examples and knowledge.
